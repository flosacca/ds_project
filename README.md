## Description

DS course project in 2019 autumn. It contains:
- Some C++ container class templates, with Ruby-style interfaces for fun.
- A simple HTML parser.
- A simple Chinese word splitter.

## Build

Since it uses WinAPI for path traversal, it can only be compiled on Windows, or you can rewrite `src/file.c`.

To make things proper, run `make` in MSYS2.
